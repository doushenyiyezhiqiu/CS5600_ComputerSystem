# Multi-Process Random String Generation and Encryption

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
1. Generating 10,000 **random strings** and writing them to a file (`strings.txt`).
2. Reading those 10,000 strings into a **queue**.
3. Spawning **child processes** to run a **cipher** program (in batches of 100 lines each), redirecting output so that each batch’s encryption result is saved in a separate file (`cipher_output_i.txt`).

We also include our **Polybius** library from a prior assignment (in `polybius.c`/`polybius.h`) and our **stub Caesar-shift cipher** (`cipher.c`). You can easily switch to the Polybius cipher by replacing the logic in `cipher.c` if desired.

## File Structure

- **Makefile**  
  Compiles both the main `multi_process` program and the `cipher` program.

- **multi_process.c**  
  Contains the main code to:
  1. Generate 10,000 random strings and save them in `strings.txt`.
  2. Read `strings.txt` into a queue.
  3. Fork child processes in batches of 100 lines, each invoking `./cipher`.

- **queue.c / queue.h**  
  Implements a basic queue data structure, storing strings.

- **cipher.c**  
  A simple stub cipher using a naive Caesar shift (+3).  
  **Note**: This file is unchanged from the previous assignment, but you could swap in your Polybius encryption if you like.

- **polybius.c / polybius.h**  
  Your previous Polybius Square cipher implementation. In this sample, `cipher.c` does not call `polybius.c`—but it’s here to satisfy the requirement to keep your prior code. If you want `cipher` to actually use Polybius encryption, modify `cipher.c` to call `pbEncode`/`pbDecode` instead of doing the Caesar shift.

- **strings.txt**  
  Automatically generated by `./multi_process generate`.  
  Contains 10,000 random lines.  
  (A smaller sample is shown in this README for illustration.)

## Build Instructions

Make sure you have a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`). To compile everything:

1. **Build everything**:
   make all

2. **Clean (remove compiled files and generated artifacts):**:
   make clean

## How to run
1. **Generate the strings**:
   ./multi_process generate

2. **Encrypt the strings in chunks of 100**:
   ./multi_process encrypt


### Final Notes

- The **`strings.txt`** file above is just a short example with 10 lines. Your real program (`./multi_process generate`) will typically create a much larger file (10,000 lines). You can include either this short version for demonstration or none at all if your assignment instructions only require that the code generate it.
